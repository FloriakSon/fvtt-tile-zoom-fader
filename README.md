Ever wanted to realize your fantasy google maps dreams ? To let your player dive their view in murky water to find hidden treasure ? This module may be for you !

This very simple module adds configurable settings to tiles to let them fade in and out depending on client zoom level, allowing for a variety of scene aesthetics and effects such as cloud overlay, fog, clearing windows...

Assets created by me for demo purposes, not included in the module. Tile animated using the Tile Scroll module by theripper93

### Tile Settings

**Fade :**
- **Enabled :** if checked, activates the fading effect for the tile.

- **Inverted :** Switches between fading in or out. Unchecked fades out as you zoom in, checked fades out as you zoom out.

**Zoom Values :** Sets the start and end of the fade, between 0 and 1.
